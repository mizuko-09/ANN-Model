ü§ñ Customer Churn Prediction using ANN
This project uses an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) built with TensorFlow/Keras to classify whether a customer will churn based on their demographic and banking activity data.

üîç Project Highlights
Model: Developed an ANN with dense layers and ReLU/Sigmoid activations.

Dataset: Used structured data with 10,000+ customer records from a bank churn dataset.

Preprocessing: Handled duplicates, encoded categorical features, and applied feature scaling.

Performance: Trained over 100 epochs and visualized accuracy/loss curves to track learning progress.

Modular Design: Built with TensorFlow for seamless reuse in binary classification tasks.
